## Looking Ahead

I am currently enrolled in a one-year professional apprenticeship program. My training as a Fullstack web developer focuses on technologies including React, TypeScript, Node.js, GraphQL, and Docker. In my workplace, I have the opportunity to work with technologies such as Angular, Node.js, and MS SQL.
My aim is to continue learning and growing as a developer throughout this experience. I am excited to apply the knowledge gained during my training to real-world projects in a professional setting.
Thank you for taking the time to learn about me. Feel free to explore my GitHub projects and contributions. I am open to collaboration and eager to contribute to the success of exciting projects together!"

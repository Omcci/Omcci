## About Me

Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Omar Melloulchi aka <b>Omcci</b> I'm currently on a journey to pursue my passion for tech as a web developer, and I'm excited to share my progress with you.



After working as a coach and physical education teacher for several years, I realized that my true passion lies in the world of tech. I've always been drawn to the idea of creating something from scratch and watching it come to life, and that's what led me to embark on this new adventure.

As part of my training at the Wild Code School, I've already completed some exciting projects that I'm proud to share with you :
  - First project was a fictive CV for Mario. It was a fun challenge to bring a beloved video game character to life in a professional setting.

  - Second project was a fitness app that involved fetching APIs. As a teamleader of the project we worked with scrum methods and sprints for each features. It was a great opportunity to combine my passion for fitness with my newfound love for tech. I'm excited about the potential of this app and how it could help people reach their fitness goals.

Currently, I'm still in the process of completing my Fullstack web developer training, with a focus on Javascript, React, NodeJS, mySQL, and Express. I'm eager to apply my experience and knowledge to my future career in tech.

As I move forward, I'm actively seeking an apprenticeship in a professional contract starting from September 2023. I'm excited to continue learning and growing as a developer, and I can't wait to see where this journey takes me.

<h1>Software Developer</h1>


## About Me

Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Omar Melloulchi aka <b>Omcci</b> I'm currently on a journey to pursue my passion for tech as a web developer, and I'm excited to share my progress with you.



After working as a coach and physical education teacher for several years, I realized that my true passion lies in the world of tech. I've always been drawn to the idea of creating something from scratch and watching it come to life, and that's what led me to embark on this new adventure.


## Project Showcase

As part of my training at the Wild Code School, I've already completed some exciting projects that I'm proud to share with you :

### Food Recipe App with React, NodeJS, Sass

This app has been realized in 5 days for a technical test by a company. The user can access to a full database of recipes, add them inside a menu which can be customized. It's a complete app that involve a database use with a CRUD.

## Looking Ahead

Currently, I'm still in the process of completing my Fullstack web developer training, with a focus on Javascript, React, NodeJS, mySQL, and Express. I'm eager to apply my experience and knowledge to my future career in tech.

As I move forward, I'm actively seeking an apprenticeship in a professional contract starting from September 2023. I'm excited to continue learning and growing as a developer, and I can't wait to see where this journey takes me.

Thank you for taking the time to read about me, and feel free to browse through my projects and contributions on GitHub. Let's connect and collaborate to make great things happen!
